# HSBC CSV Extension
> This Chrome extension scrapes a HSBC UK bank account page to produce a CSV file with all the transactions within a certain date
It is available on the Chrome store [here](https://to.joshheng.co.uk/hsbccsvextension)

## Update
> As HSBC have now updated their website with an in-built method to export transactions as CSV files, this project has now been abandoned and is no longer being maintained.
